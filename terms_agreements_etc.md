TABULENSIS TERMS OF SERVICE AND SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Effective Date: January 22, 2026
Last Updated: January 22, 2026

These Terms of Service and Software License Agreement (the "Terms") are a legal agreement between you ("you" or "Customer") and Tabulensis ("we," "us," or "our"). Tabulensis is owned and operated by Stephen Dvorak in Tennessee, United States.

These Terms govern your access to and use of the Tabulensis website and the Tabulensis software, including the desktop application and command-line interface (CLI), and any related services we provide.

BY USING THE WEBSITE OR SOFTWARE, OR BY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE TABULENSIS.

1) DEFINITIONS
"Software" means the Tabulensis desktop application and CLI, including updates and documentation.
"Website" means https://tabulensis.com and related pages, including /download, /docs, /support, /terms, and /privacy.
"Plan" means a paid subscription or trial offering described on the Website or at checkout.
"Subscription Term" means the period for which your subscription is active (for example, an annual term).
"License Key" means a code or credential that enables activation of the Software.
"Device" means a single computer or environment where the Software is installed and activated.
"Web Demo" means any browser-based demonstration experience made available on the Website, if any.

2) ELIGIBILITY AND AUTHORITY
You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you live) and able to form a binding contract.
If you use Tabulensis on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization, and "you" includes that organization.

3) THE SOFTWARE AND WEB DEMO
3.1 Software Purpose
Tabulensis is intended to help compare spreadsheet/workbook files and produce diff outputs for review.

3.2 Web Demo
If we offer a Web Demo, it is provided for evaluation and marketing purposes and may differ from the Software in features, limits, and availability. We may change or discontinue the Web Demo at any time.

4) LICENSE GRANT
4.1 License
Subject to these Terms and your payment of applicable fees, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license during the Subscription Term to install and use the Software for your internal use.

4.2 Per-User License
Unless otherwise stated at checkout, licenses are per-user. You may not share a License Key across multiple users.

4.3 Device Activation Limit
Unless otherwise stated at checkout, a per-user license may be activated on up to two (2) Devices at a time. You may be required to deactivate a Device to activate a new one.

4.4 Restrictions
You agree not to, and not to enable others to:
(a) copy, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, or transfer the Software except as expressly permitted by these Terms;
(b) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms from the Software, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law;
(c) circumvent, disable, or interfere with licensing, activation, security, or usage limits;
(d) use the Software to develop or improve a competing product;
(e) remove or alter proprietary notices in the Software or documentation.

4.5 Reservation of Rights
We retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, Website, and associated intellectual property. No rights are granted except as expressly stated.

5) ACTIVATION, LICENSE KEYS, AND ENFORCEMENT
5.1 Activation
The Software requires activation using a License Key. Activation may involve transmitting a License Key and a Device identifier to our licensing systems.

5.2 Offline Use
We may support limited offline use via a locally stored token that periodically requires revalidation. Offline duration and revalidation rules may vary by Plan and may change with notice.

5.3 Misuse
We may suspend or terminate License Keys and access if we reasonably believe there is fraud, abuse, sharing beyond permitted limits, chargeback abuse, or attempts to bypass licensing controls.

6) PLANS, TRIALS, BILLING, AND TAXES
6.1 Plans and Pricing
Plans, features, limits, and pricing are described on the Website or at checkout and are incorporated into these Terms by reference. Pricing may change over time; changes will apply at renewal or as otherwise disclosed at checkout.

6.2 Free Trial (30 Days)
If you start a free trial, it lasts for 30 days unless otherwise stated at signup for a specific promotion. We may require a payment method to start a trial. If a payment method is on file, you authorize us (and our payment processors) to charge the subscription fee at the end of the trial unless you cancel before the trial ends.

6.3 Automatic Renewal
Unless you cancel before renewal, subscriptions renew automatically for the renewal term shown at checkout (for example, annual). You authorize us (and our payment processors) to charge renewal fees, taxes, and applicable amounts to your payment method.

6.4 Cancellation
You may cancel renewal at any time by contacting support@tabulensis.com. Cancellation stops future renewals; it does not retroactively refund prior charges except as required by law.

6.5 Failed Payments
If a payment fails, we may retry. If payment is not received within a reasonable time, we may suspend access or downgrade functionality until payment is made.

6.6 Refund Policy (No Refunds After Trial)
If you started with a free trial, all fees charged after the trial ends are non-refundable. We do not provide refunds for renewals or subsequent charges. If you purchase without a trial, fees are non-refundable. Nothing in these Terms limits any statutory rights you may have (for example, rights that cannot be waived under applicable law).

6.7 Taxes
Prices may exclude taxes unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for any applicable sales, use, VAT, GST, or similar taxes, except where we are required by law to collect and remit them.

7) SUPPORT AND UPDATES

Support is provided on a best-effort basis via email at support@tabulensis.com. We aim to respond within 2 business days, with no service-level agreement.

(d) to attempt unauthorized access to the Website or licensing systems.

10) THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND OPEN-SOURCE COMPONENTS

THE SOFTWARE, WEBSITE, AND ANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE."
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BACKUPS AND FOR VALIDATING RESULTS BEFORE RELYING ON THEM.

12) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

(b) OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE SOFTWARE, OR THE WEBSITE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR TABULENSIS IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (OR, IF YOU PAID NOTHING, USD $50).

13) INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tabulensis and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from (a) your misuse of the Software or Website, (b) your violation of these Terms, or (c) your infringement of rights of any third party.

### Where to put the Terms page

Since you’re serving **static pages on Cloudflare** and you want `https://tabulensis.com/terms`, put it in your website repo as a route that builds to that URL:

* **Static (no framework):** create `terms/index.html`
* **Astro:** create `src/pages/terms.astro` (or `src/pages/terms.md`)
* **Next.js:** create `pages/terms.tsx` (or `app/terms/page.tsx`)

Then:

* Link it in the site footer/nav: **Terms**, **Privacy**, **EULA**, **Third-Party Notices**
* On `/download`, add a short line: “By downloading or using Tabulensis, you agree to the EULA and Terms.”

If you want the fastest possible path, use a simple HTML wrapper with `white-space: pre-wrap;` and paste the Terms text inside (I can generate the wrapper if you want).

END OF EULA
```

## 2) Third-Party Notices (required for proprietary distributions)

You should ship a **Third-Party Notices** file with every release artifact and also publish it on the website (good for transparency and risk reduction). Because your dependency tree is large, you want this **generated**, not hand-maintained.

### File to create

`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` (or `.html` if you want nicer formatting)

Here’s a compliant starting document you can ship immediately, with generation instructions baked in:

```text
TABULENSIS THIRD-PARTY NOTICES

Effective Date: January 22, 2026
Last Updated: January 22, 2026

Tabulensis includes third-party software components that are licensed under their own terms. Copyright and license notices for those components are provided below or are available upon request.

How to regenerate this file (recommended):
- Rust dependencies: use a dependency license reporting tool (for example, "cargo about" or "cargo license") from the root of the Tabulensis repository to produce an up-to-date list of dependency names, authors (if available), and licenses.
- JavaScript dependencies (if any): use a JavaScript license reporting tool (for example, "license-checker") within the relevant package directory.

This Third-Party Notices file is intended to satisfy attribution requirements for included third-party components. If you believe any required notice is missing or incorrect, please contact support@tabulensis.com.

END OF THIRD-PARTY NOTICES
```

### Where to put it

* **Website:** `https://tabulensis.com/third-party-notices`

  * Static: `third-party-notices/index.html`
  * Astro: `src/pages/third-party-notices.astro` (or `.md`)
* **Every release artifact:** place it next to the executable(s) in the `.zip` / `.tar.gz` / installer bundle.
* **Inside the app UI:** add a Help/About menu item that opens this text.

---

## 3) A simple proprietary “license notice” file (recommended)

Create `LICENSE.txt` in your release artifacts (and repo root), so there’s never ambiguity:

```text
TABULENSIS PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE

Copyright (c) 2026 Stephen Dvorak. All rights reserved.

This software is proprietary and is licensed, not sold.
Use of this software is subject to the Tabulensis End User License Agreement (EULA) available at:
https://tabulensis.com/eula

For Terms of Service (including billing and trial terms), see:
https://tabulensis.com/terms
```

### Where to put it

* **Website:** optional (you can just host EULA + Terms)
* **Every release artifact:** include alongside the binaries
* **Repo root:** helps you keep your own house clean (and makes future audits easier)

---

## Website routes to create (minimum set)

* `/terms` (the Terms page you already have)
* `/eula` (the EULA above)
* `/third-party-notices` (the notices file)

And put those three links in the footer of **every** marketing/docs page and on `/download`.

If you tell me what your Cloudflare Pages site repo looks like (framework vs plain static; even just its top-level file tree), I’ll give you the exact filenames to add and a drop-in HTML wrapper for each page that looks clean and readable.
