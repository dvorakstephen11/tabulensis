Tabulensis Third-Party Notices

This product includes third-party open source components. For an up-to-date
list of dependencies and licenses:

- Rust dependencies: run `cargo about generate` or `cargo license` from the
  repository root.
- JavaScript dependencies (if any): run a JS license reporting tool within the
  relevant package directory (for example, `npx license-checker`).

The notices generated by those tools should be included in release artifacts
alongside this file.
