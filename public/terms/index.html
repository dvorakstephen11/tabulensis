        <div class="legal-text">TABULENSIS TERMS OF SERVICE AND SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Effective Date: January 22, 2026
Last Updated: January 22, 2026

These Terms of Service and Software License Agreement (the "Terms") are a legal agreement between you ("you" or "Customer") and Tabulensis ("we," "us," or "our"). Tabulensis is owned and operated by Stephen Dvorak in Tennessee, United States.

These Terms govern your access to and use of the Tabulensis website and the Tabulensis software, including the desktop application and command-line interface (CLI), and any related services we provide.

BY USING THE WEBSITE OR SOFTWARE, OR BY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE TABULENSIS.

1) DEFINITIONS
"Software" means the Tabulensis desktop application and CLI, including updates and documentation.
"Website" means https://tabulensis.com and related pages, including /download, /docs, /support, /terms, and /privacy.
"Plan" means a paid subscription or trial offering described on the Website or at checkout.
"Subscription Term" means the period for which your subscription is active (for example, an annual term).
"License Key" means a code or credential that enables activation of the Software.
"Device" means a single computer or environment where the Software is installed and activated.
"Web Demo" means any browser-based demonstration experience made available on the Website, if any.

2) ELIGIBILITY AND AUTHORITY
You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you live) and able to form a binding contract.
If you use Tabulensis on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization, and "you" includes that organization.

3) THE SOFTWARE AND WEB DEMO
3.1 Software Purpose
Tabulensis is intended to help compare spreadsheet/workbook files and produce diff outputs for review.

3.2 Web Demo
If we offer a Web Demo, it is provided for evaluation and marketing purposes and may differ from the Software in features, limits, and availability. We may change or discontinue the Web Demo at any time.

4) LICENSE GRANT
4.1 License
Subject to these Terms and your payment of applicable fees, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license during the Subscription Term to install and use the Software for your internal use.

4.2 Per-User License
Unless otherwise stated at checkout, licenses are per-user. You may not share a License Key across multiple users.

4.3 Device Activation Limit
Unless otherwise stated at checkout, a per-user license may be activated on up to two (2) Devices at a time. You may be required to deactivate a Device to activate a new one.

4.4 Restrictions
You agree not to, and not to enable others to:
(a) copy, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, or transfer the Software except as expressly permitted by these Terms;
(b) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms from the Software, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law;
(c) circumvent, disable, or interfere with licensing, activation, security, or usage limits;
(d) use the Software to develop or improve a competing product;
(e) remove or alter proprietary notices in the Software or documentation.

4.5 Reservation of Rights
We retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, Website, and associated intellectual property. No rights are granted except as expressly stated.

5) ACTIVATION, LICENSE KEYS, AND ENFORCEMENT
5.1 Activation
The Software requires activation using a License Key. Activation may involve transmitting a License Key and a Device identifier to our licensing systems.

5.2 Offline Use
We may support limited offline use via a locally stored token that periodically requires revalidation. Offline duration and revalidation rules may vary by Plan and may change with notice.

5.3 Misuse
We may suspend or terminate License Keys and access if we reasonably believe there is fraud, abuse, sharing beyond permitted limits, chargeback abuse, or attempts to bypass licensing controls.

6) PLANS, TRIALS, BILLING, AND TAXES
6.1 Plans and Pricing
Plans, features, limits, and pricing are described on the Website or at checkout and are incorporated into these Terms by reference. Pricing may change over time; changes will apply at renewal or as otherwise disclosed at checkout.

6.2 Free Trial (30 Days)
If you start a free trial, it lasts for 30 days unless otherwise stated at signup for a specific promotion. We may require a payment method to start a trial. If a payment method is on file, you authorize us (and our payment processors) to charge the subscription fee at the end of the trial unless you cancel before the trial ends.

6.3 Automatic Renewal
Unless you cancel before renewal, subscriptions renew automatically for the renewal term shown at checkout (for example, annual). You authorize us (and our payment processors) to charge renewal fees, taxes, and applicable amounts to your payment method.

6.4 Cancellation
You may cancel renewal at any time by contacting support@tabulensis.com. Cancellation stops future renewals; it does not retroactively refund prior charges except as required by law.

6.5 Failed Payments
If a payment fails, we may retry. If payment is not received within a reasonable time, we may suspend access or downgrade functionality until payment is made.

6.6 Refund Policy (No Refunds After Trial)
If you started with a free trial, all fees charged after the trial ends are non-refundable. We do not provide refunds for renewals or subsequent charges. If you purchase without a trial, fees are non-refundable. Nothing in these Terms limits any statutory rights you may have (for example, rights that cannot be waived under applicable law).

6.7 Taxes
Prices may exclude taxes unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for any applicable sales, use, VAT, GST, or similar taxes, except where we are required by law to collect and remit them.

7) SUPPORT AND UPDATES
7.1 Support
Support is provided on a best-effort basis via email at support@tabulensis.com. We aim to respond within 2 business days, with no service-level agreement.

7.2 Updates
We may provide updates, patches, and new versions. Some updates may be required to continue using the Software (for example, security or licensing updates). Features may change over time.

8) DATA, PRIVACY, AND TELEMETRY
8.1 Your Files
You are responsible for the files you choose to process with Tabulensis. You represent that you have the rights necessary to use those files with the Software.

8.2 Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy at https://tabulensis.com/privacy explains what information we collect and how we use it. The Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference.

8.3 Licensing and Operational Data
To operate licensing and prevent abuse, we may process information such as your email address, subscription status, License Key, activation timestamps, and Device identifiers (which may be hashed or derived from system attributes). We do not need your spreadsheet contents to operate licensing.

8.4 Telemetry (If Any)
If we collect product analytics or crash reports, we will describe it in the Privacy Policy and, where required, provide choices or controls.

9) ACCEPTABLE USE
You will not use the Software or Website:
(a) for unlawful activities;
(b) to infringe intellectual property or privacy rights;
(c) to transmit malware or interfere with systems;
(d) to attempt unauthorized access to the Website or licensing systems.

10) THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND OPEN-SOURCE COMPONENTS
The Software may include third-party and/or open-source components governed by their own licenses. Those licenses may grant you additional rights and are not modified by these Terms. Third-party services (including payment processing) are subject to their terms.

11) DISCLAIMERS
THE SOFTWARE, WEBSITE, AND ANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE."
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT OUTPUTS WILL BE COMPLETE OR ACCURATE FOR ALL FILES OR USE CASES.
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BACKUPS AND FOR VALIDATING RESULTS BEFORE RELYING ON THEM.

12) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:
(a) WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY;
(b) OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE SOFTWARE, OR THE WEBSITE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR TABULENSIS IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (OR, IF YOU PAID NOTHING, USD $50).

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in those cases, these limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.

13) INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tabulensis and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from (a) your misuse of the Software or Website, (b) your violation of these Terms, or (c) your infringement of rights of any third party.

14) TERM AND TERMINATION
14.1 Term
These Terms begin when you first use the Software or Website and continue until terminated.

14.2 Termination by You
You may stop using the Software at any time. You may cancel subscriptions as described in Section 6.4.

14.3 Termination by Us
We may suspend or terminate access to the Software or Website if you materially breach these Terms, if we must do so to comply with law, or to prevent fraud or abuse.

14.4 Effect of Termination
Upon termination, your license ends and you must stop using the Software. Sections that by their nature should survive (including intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and dispute terms) survive termination.

15) EXPORT CONTROLS AND SANCTIONS
You may not use, export, or re-export the Software in violation of applicable export laws or sanctions. You represent that you are not located in a comprehensively sanctioned jurisdiction or on a restricted party list.

16) DISPUTES, GOVERNING LAW, AND VENUE
16.1 Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

16.2 Venue
Except where prohibited by law, you agree that disputes will be brought exclusively in the state courts located in Maury County, Tennessee, or the federal courts located in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

17) CHANGES TO THESE TERMS
We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice via the Website or within the Software. Continued use after the effective date of the updated Terms constitutes acceptance.
