Effective Date: January 22, 2026
Last Updated: January 22, 2026

This End User License Agreement (the "EULA") is a legal agreement between you ("you" or "Customer") and Tabulensis ("we," "us," or "our"). Tabulensis is owned and operated by Stephen Dvorak in Tennessee, United States.

This EULA governs your installation and use of the Tabulensis software, including the desktop application and command-line interface (CLI), and any related updates and documentation (collectively, the "Software").

BY INSTALLING, ACTIVATING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

1) RELATIONSHIP TO WEBSITE TERMS
Your purchase, subscription, billing, trial, refunds, and website use are governed by the Tabulensis Terms of Service available at https://tabulensis.com/terms (the "Terms"). If there is a conflict between this EULA and the Terms regarding billing or refunds, the Terms control.

2) LICENSE GRANT
2.1 Licensed, Not Sold
The Software is licensed, not sold.

2.2 License
Subject to this EULA and (if applicable) your payment of fees and compliance with the Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Software for your internal purposes during the applicable subscription term (or trial term, if applicable).

2.3 Per-User License and Device Limit
Unless otherwise stated at checkout or in writing by us, licenses are per-user and may be activated on up to two (2) Devices at a time. You may need to deactivate a Device to activate on a new Device.

2.4 Trial License
If you access the Software under a free trial, the trial lasts thirty (30) days unless otherwise stated for a specific promotion. Trial access may require a payment method and will convert to paid access as described in the Terms unless you cancel before the trial ends.

3) RESTRICTIONS
You agree not to, and not to enable others to:
(a) copy, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, or transfer the Software or your license except as expressly permitted by this EULA;
(b) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms from the Software, except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law;
(c) circumvent, disable, tamper with, or interfere with licensing, activation, security, or usage limits;
(d) use the Software to develop or improve a competing product or service;
(e) remove or alter proprietary notices in the Software or documentation;
(f) use the Software in violation of applicable laws.

4) OWNERSHIP
We retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software and all related intellectual property. No rights are granted except as expressly stated in this EULA.

5) ACTIVATION, LICENSE KEYS, AND ENFORCEMENT
5.1 Activation
The Software may require activation using a License Key or other credential. Activation may involve transmitting a License Key and a Device identifier to our licensing systems.

5.2 Offline Use
We may support limited offline use via a locally stored token that periodically requires revalidation. Offline duration and revalidation rules may vary by plan and may change with notice.

5.3 Suspension/Termination for Misuse
We may suspend or terminate licenses or access if we reasonably believe there is fraud, abuse, sharing beyond permitted limits, chargeback abuse, or attempts to bypass licensing controls.

6) UPDATES AND CHANGES
We may provide updates, patches, and new versions. Some updates may be required to continue using the Software (for example, security or licensing updates). Features may change over time.

7) SUPPORT
Support is provided on a best-effort basis via email at support@tabulensis.com. We aim to respond within two (2) business days, with no service-level agreement.

8) YOUR CONTENT AND PRIVACY
8.1 Your Files
You are responsible for the files you choose to process with the Software. You represent that you have the rights necessary to use those files with the Software.

8.2 Privacy
Our Privacy Policy at https://tabulensis.com/privacy explains what information we collect and how we use it. The Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference.

8.3 Licensing and Operational Data
To operate licensing and prevent abuse, we may process information such as your email address, subscription status, License Key, activation timestamps, and Device identifiers (which may be hashed or derived from system attributes). We do not need your spreadsheet contents to operate licensing.

9) HIGH-RISK USE
The Software is not designed for, and you may not use it in, any application where failure could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage, including life support or emergency medical operations.

10) DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE."
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT OUTPUTS WILL BE COMPLETE OR ACCURATE FOR ALL FILES OR USE CASES.
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BACKUPS AND FOR VALIDATING RESULTS BEFORE RELYING ON THEM.

11) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:
(a) WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY;
(b) OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS EULA OR THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR TABULENSIS IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (OR, IF YOU PAID NOTHING, USD $50).

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in those cases, these limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.

12) TERMINATION
This EULA is effective until terminated. Your rights under this EULA terminate automatically if you fail to comply with it. Upon termination, you must stop using the Software and uninstall/delete all copies under your control.

13) EXPORT CONTROLS AND SANCTIONS
You may not use, export, or re-export the Software in violation of applicable export laws or sanctions. You represent that you are not located in a comprehensively sanctioned jurisdiction or on a restricted party list.

14) GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE
This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
Except where prohibited by law, you agree that disputes will be brought exclusively in the state courts located in Maury County, Tennessee, or the federal courts located in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

15) ENTIRE AGREEMENT; CHANGES
This EULA and the Terms (and the Privacy Policy) constitute the entire agreement regarding the Software and supersede prior understandings on that subject. We may update this EULA from time to time; if we make material changes, we will provide notice via the Website or within the Software. Continued use after the effective date of an updated EULA constitutes acceptance.
