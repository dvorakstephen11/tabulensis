I want you to create the ultimate feature and marketing guide that will guide me from my current MVP status to the most feature-rich product that works across Excel, Power BI, DAX, Tabular, and anything else that might be valuable, and does everything that every other product does.

This will serve as my roadmap going forward. I will iterate over it many times in the coming days, weeks, and months.

It should lay out very clear iterations that each contain a new feature progression, brief technical details related to the development of the feature including how difficult it will be relative to all the other features that currently exist or are proposed, any applicable pricing or package changes (sometimes I suspect there won't be any), and how to maximize marketing success based on the feature progression.

Make this as dense and comprehensives as you can.

I also want you to identify information that would be useful to you in order to improve or expand your suggestions, and I'll use that information as the basis for further research and refinement of the roadmap.
