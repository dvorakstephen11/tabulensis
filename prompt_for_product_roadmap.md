# Iteration Guidance
For each iteration, create a detailed implementation and review map:
- What features will be added to this iteration?
- HOW will these features be added?
- Relative to all the features in the roadmap (existing and future), how technically difficult is this feature?
- What tests will be added?
- How should performance metrics change (stay the same or get reduced)?
- How will the new features affect the security of the app?
- What new pricing or packages will be associated with this new feature set?
- How will marketing change based on this new feature set?
- Which competitors will be addressed by this feature change?
