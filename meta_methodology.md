What I need to be doing every day

* Until completion  
  * Make use of all basic marketing avenues  
  * Remove all obstacles users would face in downloading, installing, and using the product  
  * Onboard all necessary vendors and their tools that are useful to my product  
  * Expand automation of vendor usage  
    * Reading and synthesizing emails in Fastmail inbox  
* Until acquisition  
  * UI/UX Improvement  
  * Performance improvement experiment  
  * New marketing efforts  
    * Could be a new demo video, a new partnership, cold sales calls, or a new ad placement  
  * Market analysis and awareness, aimed toward getting acquired  
    * Includes my own reading along these lines  
  * Implementing a planned feature or workflow  
  * Brainstorming new features and workflows  
  * Improving the internal analytical system (i.e., analyzing users’ activity when using Tabulensis)  
  * Platform security improvements  
    * AI-driven vulnerability discovery  
  * Learning how to expand my use of AI tools for every aspect of this project.  
  * Expand coverage of documentation for operating procedures (e.g., how   
  * Creating a log of everything I've accomplished each day and updating live checklists.  
  * Improve this meta-methodology  
* How to do this  
  * Make a meta-doc describing this effort. Maybe create a script that will dispatch N Codex agents to perform each of these tasks or at least some portion of the task.  
    * Can I automate worktree isolation?  
    * Market analysis involves copying the deep research prompt to two different deep research chats in ChatGPT, pasting the outputs into a file in the appropriate location, and having one or more Codex agents synthesize all the new information and add it to the research log (which is an input into each of the deep research chats).  
  * Information about EVERYTHING that is accomplished should be sorted and appended to the relevant docs, which will form context for future prompts  
* One-time questions  
  * What is my schedule for implementing these? The goal needs to be to get these all underway and finished as soon as possible each day.  
  * Workday schedule:  
    * Midnight  
      * An always-on script kicks off the first round of automation  
        * Codex agent that looks for performance improvement opportunities and runs an experiment  
        * Codex agent that looks for next UI/UX improvement (not sure if I want it to attempt it)  
          * Must be   
          * This could also be replaced by one or more calls to GPT-5.x-Pro   
        * Codex agent that reads meta documentation (including this file) and considers ways to improve automation, reduce friction, etc.  
        * Codex agent that reads meta documentation and puts together the day’s checklist of all the things that I need to do manually.

    * 5am-7am  
      * Kickoff second round of automation (if applicable) and listen to the first set of generated audio while exercising, if applicable  
        * Deep research queries  
      * Try to do any of the manual tasks that were decided upon in the midnight run  
    * 8:20  
      * Kickoff third (and probably last?) round of automation.  
      * Finish listening to any generated audio  
      * Do some manual tasks  
    * 9-12  
      * Sourcewell and Sound BI work  
    * 1-4:15/5:15  
      * Do all remaining manual tasks  
      * Do any remaining Sound BI work
