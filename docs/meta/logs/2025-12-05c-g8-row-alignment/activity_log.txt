Activity Log - 2025-12-05c-g8-row-alignment
============================================

- Read mini-spec and decision record to confirm scope: single row insert/delete alignment for small spreadsheet grids (G8).
- Reviewed core/src/engine.rs (positional diff baseline) and grid_view.rs (RowMeta + HashStats) to plan integration path.
- Noted constraints: gate alignment to small grids, column counts equal, row count diff == 1, avoid low-info/repetitive rows; fall back to positional otherwise.
- Added row_alignment_g8 fixture generator and manifest entries for middle insert/delete and insert+extra-edit fallback; regenerated all fixtures.
- Implemented core/src/row_alignment.rs with small-grid gating (rows<=2000, cols<=64), low-info guard (>50% low-info rows bails), and repetition guard (max row-hash freq>8 bails); single-gap alignment requires a unique inserted/deleted row and integrates into diff_grids via canonical row-mapped cell comparison.
- Added alignment module unit tests for the single insert success path and a non-monotonic mismatch fallback case; wired engine to emit aligned row add/remove ops and reuse positional diff when alignment is not safe.
- Created workbook-level G8 tests covering middle insert/delete success and a fallback case with an additional edit to ensure alignment bails.
- Ran cargo fmt, cargo clippy --all-targets (clean), and cargo test (all suites passing).
