Activity Log - 2025-11-27-datamashup-framing

- Read mini-spec docs/meta/plans/2025-11-27-datamashup-framing/spec.md and decision.yaml; noted scope for RawDataMashup framing and host API.
- Reviewed meta programming guide section 4 and architecture docs (excel_diff_technical_document.md, excel_diff_m_query_parse.md) to align implementation approach.
- Implemented RawDataMashup framing parser with strict length checks and new ExcelOpenError variants for DataMashup paths.
- Added open_data_mashup extraction (UTF-16 DataMashup parsing, base64 decode, duplicate detection) and re-exported API.
- Wrote unit tests for parse_data_mashup invariants and fuzz coverage plus integration tests for open_data_mashup fixtures.
- Corrupted fixtures/generated/corrupt_base64.xlsx DataMashup payload (one base64 character flipped) to align fixture with spec expectation.
- Ran cargo fmt, cargo clippy --all-targets, and cargo test via core/Cargo.toml (all passing).
