2025-11-30-sheet-identity-ci implementation activity log

- Initialized log; reviewed docs/meta/plans/2025-11-30-sheet-identity-ci/spec.md and decision.yaml.
- Reviewed engine and workbook code to understand current sheet identity handling (HashMap by name).
- Reviewed implementer instructions in docs/rust_docs/excel_diff_meta_programming.md section on activity logging.
- Updated core/src/workbook.rs to derive Hash for SheetKind so it can participate in sheet identity keys.
- Refactored core/src/engine.rs diff_workbooks to key sheets by (lowercased name, SheetKind) via private SheetKey + helpers and deterministic ordering (name_lower then kind rank), emitting ops with old/new casing per spec.
- Added new engine tests for case-insensitive sheet matching and kind-aware identity in core/tests/engine_tests.rs.
- Tools run: cargo fmt; cargo clippy; cargo test (all suites passing).

## Remediation Round 1
- Findings addressed: Fix 1 (deterministic sheet op ordering test), Fix 2 (case-only sheet-name fixtures + integration tests), Fix 3 (docs-vs-implementation D1 status), Fix 4 (duplicate sheet identity key policy + docs).
- Files modified/created: core/src/engine.rs; core/tests/engine_tests.rs; core/tests/output_tests.rs; fixtures/src/generators/grid.py; fixtures/src/generate.py; fixtures/manifest.yaml; fixtures/generated/sheet_case_only_rename_a.xlsx; fixtures/generated/sheet_case_only_rename_b.xlsx; fixtures/generated/sheet_case_only_rename_edit_a.xlsx; fixtures/generated/sheet_case_only_rename_edit_b.xlsx; docs/rust_docs/excel_diff_specification.md; docs/meta/plans/2025-11-30-sheet-identity-ci/spec.md; docs/rust_docs/2025-11-30-docs-vs-implementation.md; docs/meta/logs/2025-11-30-sheet-identity-ci/activity_log.txt.
- Complications: None; added a debug_assert in diff_workbooks to flag duplicate sheet identity keys while keeping release behavior deterministic (last writer wins) for invalid IR.
- Tests/tools run: cargo fmt; cargo clippy; cargo test.
