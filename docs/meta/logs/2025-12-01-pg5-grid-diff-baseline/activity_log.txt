2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline implementation activity log

- Reviewed implementer prompt and mini-spec/decision for this branch (docs/meta/plans/2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline/*) plus Section 4 of docs/rust_docs/excel_diff_meta_programming.md.
- Inspected current grid diff behavior in core/src/engine.rs along with workbook/diff types to confirm existing CellEdited-only semantics.
- Updated diff_grids to limit cell comparisons to the overlapping rectangle and emit RowAdded/RowRemoved and ColumnAdded/ColumnRemoved for tail shape differences using the DiffOp helpers.
- Added PG5 in-memory grid diff coverage with helpers (grid_from_numbers, single_sheet_workbook) and scenarios in core/tests/pg5_grid_diff_tests.rs.
- Adjusted the grid_from_numbers helper to take slices-of-slices for compile-time sizing and updated callers.
- Tools run: cargo fmt; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features; cargo test (all suites passing).

## Remediation Round 1 (2025-12-01)
- Addressed Fix 1 (truncation coverage): added pg5_7/pg5_8/pg5_9 truncation tests in core/tests/pg5_grid_diff_tests.rs.
- Addressed Fix 2 (mixed shape + content): added pg5_10 mixed overlap edits plus tail row add in core/tests/pg5_grid_diff_tests.rs.
- Addressed Fix 3 (docs refresh): updated docs/rust_docs/2025-11-30-docs-vs-implementation.md for UC-04/UC-05 tail ops and current diff_grids behavior.
- Addressed Fix 4 (remediation persistence): populated docs/meta/reviews/2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline/remediation.md; added docs/meta/remediations/2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline.md and combined_remediations.md.
- Files touched: core/tests/pg5_grid_diff_tests.rs; docs/rust_docs/2025-11-30-docs-vs-implementation.md; docs/meta/remediations/*; docs/meta/reviews/2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline/remediation.md.
- Complications: remediation.md for this branch was empty; reused remediationB.md content to restore the plan text.
- Tools run: cargo fmt; cargo test; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features.


## Remediation Round 2 (2025-12-01)
- Addressed reviewer visibility gap (missing codebase_context/cycle artifacts): ran generate_review_context.py --collate 2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline to regenerate the review package and cargo test results.
- Materialized the review package in docs/meta/reviews/2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline/review_package (codebase_context.md, cycle_plan.md, cycle_summary.txt, combined_remediations.md, rust_docs).
- No production code changes; gates rerun (cargo fmt --all -- --check, cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features, cargo test via collate).
- Files touched: docs/meta/prompts/review_prompt.md; docs/meta/results/2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline.txt; docs/meta/reviews/2025-12-01-pg5-grid-diff-baseline/review_package/*.
- Complications: none.
