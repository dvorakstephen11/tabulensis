## Remediation Round 1

- Findings addressed: Perf regressions and gating gaps from 2025-12-13 branch-3 review (col hashing sorts, repeated GridView builds, identical fast-path hash lookups, dense row diff full scans, unordered column hash sort, perf threshold constants).
- Files touched: core/src/grid_view.rs; core/src/workbook.rs; core/src/engine.rs; core/src/row_alignment.rs; core/src/column_alignment.rs; core/src/alignment/assembly.rs; core/src/alignment/mod.rs; core/Cargo.toml; scripts/check_perf_thresholds.py; core/tests/g13_fuzzy_row_move_grid_workbook_tests.rs; core/tests/m7_semantic_m_diff_tests.rs; core/tests/engine_tests.rs.
- Complications: Clippy flagged dead_code on legacy wrappers and field-reassign-on-default in tests; resolved with targeted allows and struct literal configs.
- Verification: cargo fmt; cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace; python scripts/export_perf_metrics.py (results under benchmarks/results/2025-12-13_202028.json).

## Remediation Round 2

- Findings addressed: RemediationB cell-compared metric double-counting in sparse row emitters; added unit coverage for diff_row_pair_sparse comparison counts.
- Files touched: core/src/engine.rs; benchmarks/results/2025-12-14_003645.json.
- Complications: Clippy flagged clippy::useless-vec in new tests; resolved by using fixed arrays before mapping to sparse tuples.
- Verification: cargo fmt; cargo test; cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; python scripts/export_perf_metrics.py (results saved to benchmarks/results/2025-12-14_003645.json).

## Remediation Round 3

- Findings addressed: RemediationE fixes (config defaults/presets alignment, move detection gating decoupled from recursion, include_unchanged_cells no-op filtering, perf messaging clarity, unused_mut cleanup).
- Files touched: core/src/engine.rs; core/src/output/json.rs; core/tests/g14_move_combination_tests.rs; core/tests/output_tests.rs; core/tests/perf_large_grid_tests.rs.
- Complications: move-disable test revealed AMR alignment was still emitting cell edits; resolved by treating config.max_move_iterations=0 as disabling move-based fallbacks and surfacing add/remove rows instead of masked edits.
- Verification: cargo fmt; cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace; python scripts/export_perf_metrics.py (benchmarks/results/2025-12-15_183914.json).
