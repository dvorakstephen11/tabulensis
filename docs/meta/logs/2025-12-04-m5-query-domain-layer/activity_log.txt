- Read excel_diff_meta_programming.md Section 4 to confirm implementer responsibilities and logging requirements.
- Reviewed mini-spec and decision record for branch 2025-12-04-m5-query-domain-layer (Query domain layer join of Section1 members to metadata).
- Collected context from datamashup.rs, m_section.rs, fixture generators, manifest, and existing M4 tests to plan implementation.
- Added Query domain struct and build_queries helper in core/src/datamashup.rs, joining Section1 members to metadata with deterministic ordering and duplicate handling per spec.
- Extended core/src/lib.rs exports to surface Query and build_queries for tests and future consumers.
- Expanded fixtures generator modes in fixtures/src/generators/mashup.py to cover metadata_url_encoding and metadata_orphan_entries scenarios.
- Added new scenarios to fixtures/manifest.yaml for metadata_url_encoding.xlsx and metadata_orphan_entries.xlsx.
- Extended core/src/m_section.rs parsing to support quoted shared member identifiers (e.g., #"Query with space & #") so Section1 splitting can feed new M5 fixtures.
- Regenerated fixtures via python fixtures/src/generate.py, producing new metadata_url_encoding.xlsx and metadata_orphan_entries.xlsx alongside existing scenarios.
- Added core/tests/m5_query_domain_tests.rs covering metadata join semantics, URL decoding, uniqueness invariant, and orphan metadata behavior.
- Added regression guard in core/tests/m4_permissions_metadata_tests.rs to ensure build_queries remains compatible with existing metadata fixtures.
- Ran cargo fmt, cargo clippy (clean), and cargo test (all suites passing with new fixtures).
