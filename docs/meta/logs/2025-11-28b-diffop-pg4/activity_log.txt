2025-11-28 Activity Log - PG4 DiffOp types
- Reviewed docs/meta/plans/2025-11-28b-diffop-pg4/spec.md and decision.yaml for scope/tests.
- Read process prompt at docs/rust_docs/excel_diff_meta_programming.md and implementer.md to align with roles.
- Noted branch name 2025-11-28b-diffop-pg4 (decision header references 2025-11-28-diffop-pg4; aligned during remediation round 1).
- Starting implementation: need new diff module, public re-exports, and PG4 tests per spec.
- Added core/src/diff.rs with DiffOp, DiffReport, SheetId alias, RowSignature/ColSignature and serde tags per PG4 spec; re-exported via core/src/lib.rs.
- Implemented PG4 test suite in core/tests/pg4_diffop_tests.rs covering construction, JSON shape/omission rules, round-trips, and DiffReport ordering.
- Ran cargo fmt, cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features (-D warnings); no warnings.
- Ran cargo test from core/; all suites passed including new PG4 diffop tests.

## Remediation Round 1
- Added column-side JSON shape coverage for optional signatures and block-hash fields (`ColumnAdded`/`ColumnRemoved`, `BlockMovedColumns`) and centralized a `CellEdited` invariant helper with a negative panic test; refactored PG4 tests to use the helper.
- Introduced a workspace `Cargo.toml` so `cargo test` works from the repo root while retaining `core/` as the crate manifest.
- Realigned decision/spec branch identifiers to `2025-11-28b-diffop-pg4` and noted the logs relocation requirement.
- Validation: cargo fmt; cargo clippy --all-targets --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo test (workspace root); cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml.

## Remediation Round 2
- Finding 4: Added PG4 JSON key-set tests for sheet-level, row/column (with and without signatures), and block move DiffOps to lock wire shapes across variants.
- Finding 6: Added DiffOp/DiffReport deserialization tests that reject invalid CellEdited addresses at the top level and inside snapshots, ensuring nested errors surface `"invalid cell address"` details.
- Finding 5: Documented CellEdited address invariants and equality semantics in core/src/diff.rs and linked the PG4 invariant helper comment to the Rustdoc guidance.
- Files touched: core/tests/pg4_diffop_tests.rs; core/src/diff.rs.
- Validation: cargo fmt; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features; cargo test (workspace root). Complications: none.
