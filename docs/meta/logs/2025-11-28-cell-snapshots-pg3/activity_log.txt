Activity Log - 2025-11-28-cell-snapshots-pg3

## Remediation Round 1
- Addressed Finding 1 (Missing Integration Test Implementation and Execution) by finalizing `core/tests/pg3_snapshot_tests.rs` with fixture-based snapshot assertions for the `Types` sheet and JSON round-trip coverage that validates A1-style addresses, ensuring the integration suite runs.
- Addressed Finding 2 (Deviation from JSON Format Example for CellAddress) by implementing custom serde for `CellAddress` to serialize/deserialize A1 strings and aligning round-trip expectations.
- Files modified: docs/meta/logs/2025-11-28-cell-snapshots-pg3/activity_log.txt; core/src/workbook.rs; core/tests/pg3_snapshot_tests.rs.
- Complications: none; deserialization now surfaces invalid cell addresses via `CellAddress::from_str`.
- Validation: cargo fmt; cargo clippy --all-targets; cargo test (unit and integration suites, counts now exceed unit-only runs).

## Remediation Round 2
- Addressed Finding 1 gap by hardening `snapshot_json_roundtrip` to assert address equality and adding a tampering test that highlights addr differences despite value/formula equality.
- Addressed Finding 2 (serde surface) by narrowing serde derives to snapshot-related types only (removing derives from Workbook/Sheet/Grid/Row/Cell while retaining snapshot serialization support).
- Addressed Finding 3 by treating out-of-bounds shared string indices as XML parse errors and adding a focused unit test.
- Files modified: core/tests/pg3_snapshot_tests.rs; core/src/workbook.rs; core/src/excel_open_xml.rs; docs/meta/logs/2025-11-28-cell-snapshots-pg3/activity_log.txt.
- Complications: initial wasm check needed a longer timeout; reran successfully.
- Validation: cargo fmt --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo test --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo test --tests --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo clippy --all-targets --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml.

## Remediation Round 3
- Addressed Finding 1 (JSON structure) by defining `CellDiff` as a keyed object (`coords`, `value_file1`, `value_file2`) and updating JSON serialization plus output tests to assert the object shape.
- Addressed Finding 2 (dependencies) by adding explicit `serde_json` to core dependencies to align with the JSON output surface.
- Addressed Finding 3 (empty diff coverage) with a new integration test that diffs identical fixtures and asserts an empty diff array.
- Files modified: core/Cargo.toml; core/src/lib.rs; core/src/output/json.rs; core/src/output/mod.rs; core/tests/output_tests.rs; docs/meta/logs/2025-11-28-cell-snapshots-pg3/activity_log.txt.
- Complications: none.
- Validation: cargo fmt --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo test --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo clippy --all-targets --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml.

## Remediation Round 4
- Addressed Finding 3 (missing positive JSON diff coverage) by adding a `single_cell_diff` generator scenario and fixtures (`json_diff_single_cell_a.xlsx`, `json_diff_single_cell_b.xlsx`) plus `test_json_non_empty_diff`, which asserts the expected coords/value_file1/value_file2 for a single changed cell.
- Addressed Finding 2 (doc drift on JSON output surface) by updating the decision record, mini-spec, and specification to document the public JSON helpers and the intentional runtime `serde_json` dependency.
- Addressed Finding 4 (JSON serialization error mapping) by documenting that `ExcelOpenError::XmlParseError` currently covers JSON serialization failures, with a future option to split a dedicated variant.
- Files modified/created: fixtures/src/generators/grid.py; fixtures/src/generate.py; fixtures/manifest.yaml; fixtures/generated/json_diff_single_cell_a.xlsx; fixtures/generated/json_diff_single_cell_b.xlsx; core/tests/output_tests.rs; docs/meta/plans/2025-11-28-cell-snapshots-pg3/decision.yaml; docs/meta/plans/2025-11-28-cell-snapshots-pg3/spec.md; docs/rust_docs/excel_diff_specification.md; docs/meta/logs/2025-11-28-cell-snapshots-pg3/activity_log.txt.
- Complications: none; generated only the new fixture pair.
- Validation: cargo fmt --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo clippy --all-targets --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml; cargo test --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml.
