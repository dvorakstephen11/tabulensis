## Persona

- <Finance analyst / BI developer / data engineer / auditor>

## Pain

- "We need to know what changed between two versions of a workbook/report, but diffs are manual and risky."

## What Tabulensis Does

- "Tabulensis compares Excel/PBI artifacts and outputs a structured diff: cells, sheet structure, Power Query (M), and model changes."

## Proof

- <1 metric: time-to-diff, file size, or a concrete example change>
