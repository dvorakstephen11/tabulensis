# Task: Implement [BRANCH NAME]

## Primary Reference
Implement the work specified in `docs/rust_docs/next_sprint_plan.md` for Branch 1: Grid Algorithm Correctness & Hashing.

Follow the deliverables and acceptance criteria listed in that section exactly.

## Authoritative Design Reference
When implementing algorithms, data structures, or making design decisions, consult `docs/rust_docs/unified_grid_diff_algorithm_specification.md`. This specification describes:
- **What** each algorithm must accomplish
- **Why** design decisions were made
- **How** to handle edge cases
- Complete pseudocode for core algorithms

**Hierarchy**: If the sprint plan and specification conflict, the specification takes precedence for algorithmic behavior. The sprint plan takes precedence for implementation structure and API design.

## Working Guidelines
1. Read the relevant sprint plan section completely before starting
2. For each deliverable, locate the corresponding specification section(s) for context
3. Preserve all invariants and edge case handling described in the specification
4. Mark each deliverable checkbox as you complete it
5. Run existing tests after each significant change to catch regressions
