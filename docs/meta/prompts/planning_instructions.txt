Role: Planner Agent (as defined in docs/rust_docs/excel_diff_meta_programming.md)

Objective:
Analyze the current state of the project and determine the next development cycle.

Context Provided:
1. `review_prompt.md`: A complete snapshot of the current codebase directory structure and key file contents.
2. `docs/rust_docs/*.md`: The technical blueprints, testing plans, and process documentation. (Attached to chat)
3. `README.md`: Project overview. (Attached to chat)

Instructions:
1. READ the `docs/rust_docs/excel_diff_meta_programming.md` document carefully. It is the authoritative guide for this process.
2. ANALYZE the `review_prompt.md` to understand the current implementation status. Compare it against the blueprints in `docs/rust_docs/`.
3. REVIEW any existing plans in `docs/meta/plans/` (if visible in the file tree) to see what was recently done.
4. DETERMINE the next cycle's work type (Refactor, Milestone progress, or New incremental milestone) based on the risk ledger and current status.
5. GENERATE the following artifacts for the next cycle:
   - A Decision Record (e.g., `docs/meta/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-cycle.yml`) explaining *why* this work was chosen.
   - A Mini-Spec (e.g., `docs/meta/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`) describing the scope, behavioral contract, constraints, and testing plan.
   
Do not write code yet. Your output is the Plan (Decision Record + Mini-Spec) that an Implementer Agent will use in the next step.
