I have attached several files.

initial_general_purpose_tools_revenue_conversation.md represents a conversation I had with an AI assistant about how to maximize my financial success in the next few years, particularly through building general-purpose tools related to web-scraping, knowledge graph creation, and audio transcription that would yield a variety of marketable products.

initial_quick_software_product_brainstorm_conversation.md represents a conversation I had with an AI assistant about quick and easy-to-develop software products that I could develop with the assistance of LLMs, which are powering incredibly capable coding agents.

excel_diff_product_differentiation_plan.md represents a deep dive into the competitive landscape of the Excel diff product market and a plan for how to differentiate my product.

excel_diff_technical_document.md represents a technical specification for the Excel diff product.

excel_diff_marketing_plan.md represents a marketing plan for the Excel diff product.

excel_diff_education_plan.md represents a reading plan for me as a Python developer to learn the necessary skills to build the Excel diff product in Rust.

"Excel Diff Engine Competitive Landscape.md" is a deep research repoert that has some overlap with excel_diff_product_differentiation_plan.md, but focuses on additional competitors besides xlCompare and Synkronizer.

explanation_of_excel_diff_benefits.md is my explanation of why I think this idea is a favorable one.

It seems that the idea of creating the Excel Diff product in Rust and marketing it first to the MacOS market prior to making it platform-agnostic is a suprisingly good idea. The more I research it the less quixotic it appears. I need your help evaluating if that's the case. Does the plan overlook some obvious and potentially insurmountable challenges? Is the addressable market much smaller than I think (I'm hoping for 3,000-5,000 users at a $150 lifetime price, or $60-80/year subscription price)? Is the technical feasibility of the plan realistic? Am I making any unfounded assumptions? Furthermore, is the excel diff plan superior to the general-purpose tools plan? To answer that previous question, please attempt to supply the general-purpose tools plan with the same level of detail as the excel diff plan. I spent much more time on the excel diff plan because it was so interesting, but perhaps a more thoroughly researched general-purpose tools plan would be more valuable. 

If the excel diff plan is viable and truly valuable--something that I could capitalize on to the tune of $10k in a year and $200k in a couple of years--it seems remarkable that I could find this idea in a brief conversation with an AI. I want to figure out how to recreate the success of discovering that idea so that I can find other equally valuable ideas or perhaps ideas that are even more valuable. Assuming this idea is a good one, perhaps there is some rubric I could apply to an idea (encoded as a prompt for an AI agent to apply the rubric) to evaluate its viability. Then AI could become something of an idea generator for me.
