- Submit the 11 prompts that GPT-5.1-Pro produced
    - Expand competitor analysis to include Draftable, Microsoft's Spreadsheet Compare tool, and LLM capabilities in general (including Copilot)
- Submit a deep research prompt about what kinds of workflows represent 80-90% of the user cases, and make sure my product is positioned to solve these problems, while postponing the solution of the rarer use cases.
- Submit a few consecutive questions to Deepthink on the topic of making sure that I don't code myself into a corner. At each stage of the product development, make sure that I am positioning myself in a balanced way so that I can move forward with plenty of freedom and not accidentally navigate into a dead end that forces me to rewrite large parts of the codebase.
- Submit a deep research prompt about designing performance tests in Rust
- Identify weaknesses in the product document
- User analysis:
    - YouTube
        - ask Gemini 3 Pro to analyze each of the relevant YouTube videos, plus create a data set containing all the comments
        - Spreadsheet Compare, xlCompare, Synkronizer, Draftable
        - Analyze all this information for latent user needs and pain points, indexed to timestamp of the video and comment (make sure the chronology of the complaints is accounted for in the analysis)
    - Reddit
    - Reviews
        - Google reviews
    - Microsoft Support
        - Find anything that is relevant to my product
- Technical Details
    - Find papers detailing the algorithms mentioned by Gemini 3 Pro and add those files to this directory
    - Do deep research about different ways these algorithms have been applied
- Compile data into 1-5 documents
    - Submit to another round of reviews
    - Compile the original conversation into a single document
    - Compile the alternative revenue generation ideas into a single document
    - Present these final documents to Deepthink and GPT-5.1-Pro to...
        - Compare alternative revenue generation ideas with Excel Diff idea to decide which I should pursue
        - Hold up the Excel Diff market gap identification as an excellent work of research and figure out how I can replicate it
            - Make sure there is a detailed explanation of why the Excel Diff idea works, specifically in the software environment that currently exists (defined by the advent of increasingly powerful LLMs), and have that part of the product document, which can be used as part of the prompt in a conversation that attempts to find similar software market gaps.
- Learn about all the leaders among my primary competitors
- Figure out how pbi-tools might fit into all of this
    - Can .pbix files be parsed and diffed in the same way that .xlsx files can be?
- Lots of planning on the Tauri desktop app. Haven't even started this. Compare Tauri with Electron or other cross-platform frameworks.
