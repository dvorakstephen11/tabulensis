- Submit the 11 prompts that GPT-5.1-Pro produced
    - Expand competitor analysis to include Draftable, Microsoft's Spreadsheet Compare tool, and LLM capabilities in general (including Copilot)
- Submit a deep research prompt about what kinds of workflows represent 80-90% of the user cases, and make sure my product is positioned to solve these problems, while postponing the solution of the rarer use cases.
- Submit a few consecutive questions to Deepthink on the topic of making sure that I don't code myself into a corner. At each stage of the product development, make sure that I am positioning myself in a balanced way so that I can move forward with plenty of freedom and not accidentally navigate into a dead end that forces me to rewrite large parts of the codebase.
- Submit a deep research prompt about designing performance tests in Rust
- Identify weaknesses in the product document
- User analysis:
    - YouTube
        - ask Gemini 3 Pro to analyze each of the relevant YouTube videos, plus create a data set containing all the comments
        - Spreadsheet Compare, xlCompare, Synkronizer, Draftable
        - Analyze all this information for latent user needs and pain points, indexed to timestamp of the video and comment (make sure the chronology of the complaints is accounted for in the analysis)
    - Reddit
    - Reviews
        - Google reviews
    - Microsoft Support
        - Find anything that is relevant to my product
- Technical Details
    - Find papers detailing the algorithms mentioned by Gemini 3 Pro and add those files to this directory
    - Do deep research about different ways these algorithms have been applied
- Compile data into 1-5 documents
    - Submit to another round of reviews
    - Compile the original conversation into a single document
    - Compile the alternative revenue generation ideas into a single document
    - Present these final documents to Deepthink and GPT-5.1-Pro to...
        - Compare alternative revenue generation ideas with Excel Diff idea to decide which I should pursue
        - Hold up the Excel Diff market gap identification as an excellent work of research and figure out how I can replicate it
            - Make sure there is a detailed explanation of why the Excel Diff idea works, specifically in the software environment that currently exists (defined by the advent of increasingly powerful LLMs), and have that part of the product document, which can be used as part of the prompt in a conversation that attempts to find similar software market gaps.
- Learn about all the leaders among my primary competitors
- Figure out how pbi-tools might fit into all of this
    - Can .pbix files be parsed and diffed in the same way that .xlsx files can be?
- Lots of planning on the Tauri desktop app. Haven't even started this. Compare Tauri with Electron or other cross-platform frameworks.

- Set up a system by which I can periodically compare my documentation with my entire codebase and with the latest news about my competitors, their products, and related innovations (AI advances, user behavior, security vulnerabilities, etc.) and have an ultra-powerful LLM help me update my documentation and codebase to reflect the latest information. There should also be a concise "diff" statement that I can log that will tell me what decisions and changes were made. As this log grows, I can reflect upon the decisions I made.


- Ask how to protect my IP
- Research acquisitions of similar products in the last 5 years to estimate my acquisition potential
- Brainstorm ideas about how to expand the offering
- Tiny fine-tuned model that can orchestrate complex sets of ExcelDiff tool calls based on natural language instructions (would integrate well with other agents later on)
- Spend some time thinking about the future interplay of tiny, highly-specialized models in conjunction with more capable general models. This could be a major form of income for me. I need to start curating relevant research so I can watch this sector of the industry evolve. 
- Handle password stores? Seems like a large security risk for a small value add.
- Expound upon the need to handle .xlsb and .xlsx files.
- Have multiple models do deep research to estimate revenue for Synkronizer 
- Have multiple models (in multiple isolated threads) build models to project how LLM advancement might affect my success in MED. Start by creating an AI-enhanced prompt for this deep research. 
- Get a much better idea of the Excel workflows that intersect with Excel diff (use deep research to find user discussion about this). Figure out if there is low-hanging fruit in terms of features that are not available on the market
- Ask what the greatest weakness of Rust is with respect to this product
- Identify a possible acquisition opportunity among ALL competitors. Mix this with a deep research on product lines (with feature and compatibility comparison), pricing, and company histories. The wealth of user discussion will serve as an excellent complement to this research.
- Deep dive on PerfectXL, xltrail, xlCompare, Synkronizer, and Ablebits (separately). Each main competitor needs to have its own deep dive document.
- Use LLMs to create magnificent documentation about versioning maintenance for my product, to make sure that it stays current with updates to Excel.
- Map milestones to product phases
- Put all the competitor deep dives into a single thread and research the following
- What are the tradeoffs in the WASM packaging?
- Revenue projections for my product (add in the YouTube, Reddit, and other user data as well for maximal accuracy)
- Refine or validate the product offering phases
- Perhaps my product offering in Phase 4 isn't ambitious enough? Identify all the features competitors offer that my product won't and figure out if I should expand my scope to cover some of those gaps.
- Make sure my documentation doesn't imply that I'll be attempting to offer in-Excel features.
- List all the features that have been discussed among all competitors and my own product and identify potential use cases that are not
- Research international distribution options/hurdles
