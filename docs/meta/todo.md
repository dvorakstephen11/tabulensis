# todo

- Improve design (current)
- Introduce parallelization
    - Compare performce metrics before and after parallelization
- Add PBIX diff feature
- Ask about WASM/Web, and desktop UI, and make a decision on that score
- Identify ways to make the performance even better (GPT-5.2-Pro mentioned some fallback logic that essentially defers sophisticated alignment to the future)
- Figure out where fluff exists in the codebase
- Start understanding the codebase and the product
    - Read the README.md file
    - Create two excel files and compare them
    - Download a publicly available .xlsx file, make some changes, and compare the two files
- Figure out a name for the product
- Create a full marketing plan
    - Initial GPT-5.2-Pro plan then have it propose incremental improvements, and ask questions until you feel like you know everything about how you'll proceed with marketing, legal, and distribution.




- Submit a deep research prompt about what kinds of workflows represent 80-90% of the user cases, and make sure my product is positioned to solve these problems, while postponing the solution of the rarer use cases.
- Identify weaknesses in the product document
- User analysis:
    - YouTube
        - ask Gemini 3 Pro to analyze each of the relevant YouTube videos, plus create a data set containing all the comments
        - Spreadsheet Compare, xlCompare, Synkronizer, Draftable
        - Analyze all this information for latent user needs and pain points, indexed to timestamp of the video and comment (make sure the chronology of the complaints is accounted for in the analysis)
    - Reddit
    - Reviews
        - Google reviews
    - Microsoft Support
        - Find anything that is relevant to my product
- Technical Details
    - Find papers detailing the algorithms mentioned by Gemini 3 Pro and add those files to this directory
    - Do deep research about different ways these algorithms have been applied
- Learn about all the leaders among my primary competitors
- Figure out how pbi-tools might fit into all of this
    - Can .pbix files be parsed and diffed in the same way that .xlsx files can be?
- Lots of planning on the Tauri desktop app. Haven't even started this. Compare Tauri with Electron or other cross-platform frameworks.

- Set up a system by which I can periodically compare my documentation with my entire codebase and with the latest news about my competitors, their products, and related innovations (AI advances, user behavior, security vulnerabilities, etc.) and have an ultra-powerful LLM help me update my documentation and codebase to reflect the latest information. There should also be a concise "diff" statement that I can log that will tell me what decisions and changes were made. As this log grows, I can reflect upon the decisions I made.
    - This might be something I spent $500/month to do with an API script once this is bringing in some serious money (unless I'm acquired before that happens)
- Ask how to protect my IP
- Research acquisitions of similar products in the last 5 years to estimate my acquisition potential
- Brainstorm ideas about how to expand the offering

- Spend some time thinking about the future interplay of tiny, highly-specialized models in conjunction with more capable general models. This could be a major form of income for me. I need to start curating relevant research so I can watch this sector of the industry evolve. 
- Handle password stores? Seems like a large security risk for a small value add.
- Expound upon the need to handle .xlsb and .xlsx files.
- Have multiple models (in multiple isolated threads) build models to project how LLM advancement might affect my success in MED. Start by creating an AI-enhanced prompt for this deep research. 
- Get a much better idea of the Excel workflows that intersect with Excel diff (use deep research to find user discussion about this). Figure out if there is low-hanging fruit in terms of features that are not available on the market
- Ask what the greatest weakness of Rust is with respect to this product
- Identify a possible acquisition opportunity among ALL competitors. Mix this with a deep research on product lines (with feature and compatibility comparison), pricing, and company histories. The wealth of user discussion will serve as an excellent complement to this research.
- Use LLMs to create magnificent documentation about versioning maintenance for my product, to make sure that it stays current with updates to Excel.
- What are the tradeoffs in the WASM packaging?
- Perhaps my product offering in Phase 4 isn't ambitious enough? Identify all the features competitors offer that my product won't and figure out if I should expand my scope to cover some of those gaps.
- Research international distribution options/hurdles
