In this deep research document (https://gemini.google.com/app/ab8383fb86bc2f73) it iOS and Android were mentioned as operating systems with which the COM add-ins are not compatible. Is there any compelling business reason to support these operating systems with my product, perhaps in Phase 4 or beyond?

In the near-term (next five years, prior to full-blown AGI), lots of value lies in being able to produce extremely high-quality code that handles potentially complex or tedious workflows very quickly, versus relying on an LLM to do it for you in a non-deterministic way. That's the boundary I want to inhabit in the near term. Eventually I want to create the more complex information and social network systems that focus on positive-sum activity, cooperation, and knowledge creation.

Q***: Is there not an excel equivalent on MacOS that might steal market share from my product?
- So far I'm pretty sure there's not, but I need to check. xltrail might be the closest, since 
it's web-based and can therefore be accessed on a browser on MacOS.


After each programming cycle, use the [percent_completion.md](percent_completion.md) document to ask an LLM (or two or three) to estimate the percentage of the project that is complete.
