# Installer UX Improvements

Planned improvements for release packaging:

- Windows: MSI installer with Add/Remove Programs entry and PATH option.
- macOS: notarized DMG with drag-and-drop install for the desktop app.
- Linux: AppImage plus optional .deb/.rpm packages.

These require signed artifacts and will be implemented alongside the signing pipeline.
