# ANALYSIS COMPARISON - A
What do you think of the attached analysis, which was produced with the same prompt and source materials? Does this provide any information that would allow you to enhance your evaluation? Where this analysis conflicts with yours, compare those conflicts with minimal bias and explain in detail which analysis is correct with respect to that conflict. Don't forget to consider third alternatives; perhaps both positions are inferior to a third position that you come up with. Please identify every idea that is proposed in each analysis, highlighting overlap (either agreement or or conflict) and differentation. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each analysis and list the ideas and statements from both analyses that, when integrated, would form a third analysis that is better than both of the individual analyses, by virtue of combing all the strenghts and none of the weaknesses of the original analyses.



# ANALYSIS COMPARISON - B
Combination of @design_evaluation.md prompt and and some the two other analyses. Find the truths that are common to both analyses, the correct position where the two analyses conflict with each other, the unique insights from each analysis, and high-quality ideas or insights that are not present in either of the original analyses.
