# eval_UED_prompt

I have attached an evaluation of my codebase (unified_eval_draft) along with the codebase and some documentation that specifies how the major technological features of the excel diff project should be created.

I would like you to evaluate the unified_eval_draft as rigorously as possible. Briefly highlight what it definitely gets correct but then highlight in more detail anything it gets wrong (if anything). Also, if there is something in the spec that is being worked toward but is actually suboptimal, reveal that. Finally, identify any missed insights that would be useful to incorporate into the evaluation.
