### 1. Go-to-Market Phases
**Phase 1: Beachhead.** Target the neglected macOS segment (finance pros, VCs, consultants). Channels: SEO (“Excel compare Mac”), Mac App Store for trust, Product Hunt/Show HN for tech visibility. Pricing: freemium web viewer plus pro desktop at ~$15–$20/month.  
**Phase 2: Modern Excel Attack.** Launch M/DAX diff; publish technical deep dives proving catches that incumbents miss; engage Power BI and financial modeling communities; partner with trainers and consultants. Positioning: “The first comparison tool for Modern Excel.”  
**Phase 3: Workflow Expansion.** Add collaboration (comments on diffs, shareable links, audit trails) and Git/CI/CD integration; pursue direct sales to finance/audit/compliance teams with team and enterprise tiers.

### 2. Pricing Strategy
Benchmarks: xlCompare $99.99 perpetual; Synkronizer ~€99–€199. A $75 one-time license is likely too low. Prefer a “modern perpetual” at ~$149 including one year of updates, with optional ~$49/year renewals, or a SaaS plan at $15–$20/month for desktop with unlimited comparisons. Keep the web viewer free/read-only for small files as top-of-funnel and conversion driver.


### 3. Sales Channels: Personal Website, Stripe, and Gumroad

**Is it feasible to sell this through a personally owned website using Stripe and Gumroad? Yes, absolutely.** This is the standard approach for independent software vendors (ISVs).

#### The Crucial Role of the Merchant of Record (MoR)

The key challenge in selling software globally is tax compliance (VAT, Sales Tax).

*   **Stripe (Payment Processor):** Stripe handles the payment, but *you* are responsible for calculating, collecting, and remitting all global taxes. This is a massive administrative and legal burden.
*   **Merchant of Record (MoR) (e.g., Gumroad, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy):** The MoR acts as the legal reseller. They handle payments, invoicing, and, critically, all tax compliance. They charge a slightly higher fee but save immense effort.

**Recommendation:** Use a specialized MoR designed for software, such as **Paddle** or **Lemon Squeezy**. They offer better licensing and subscription management features than Gumroad (which is more focused on general creators) and handle the tax burden, allowing you to focus on the product.

### 4. Acquisition Outlook
With core tech (Rust engine, WASM/web, macOS app) and Modern Excel parsing, an early tech/IP acquisition could land in the $300k–$700k range. With cross-platform delivery, M/DAX leadership, and demonstrated revenue/brand traction (Phase 2), xlCompare or others could rationalize $1.5M–$4M for build-vs-buy, market expansion, and defensive motives—especially if competitive tension is introduced.
